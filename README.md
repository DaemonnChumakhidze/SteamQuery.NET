# SteamQuery.NET
Go home README.md, you're drunk.

# Read here before using the library!
I've just started developing this. It currently works on most Source servers. I'll add support for more protocols, but not soon.


# How to Use
I am too lazy. Just check ExampleApplication project. I will edit here for sure.

# To-Do
- Compile for .NET Framework too. _(Fuck .NET Standard, all my homies use .NET 5.0.)_
- Switch to Steam Web API to support server listing, querying every game and every query protocol.
